# The Effects of Changing the Census Race and Ethnicity Question

This experiment was performed for the MIDS W241 Experiments and Causality class in Summer 2019

Team members: Katie Mo and Kat Borojerdi

**Abstract**
The following study examined the potential impact of changing the current race and ethnicity question on the US Census Survey. By studying this topic, we evaluated whether changing the way data is collected will improve race and ethnic representation in the US Census. Based on our findings, we can not make a direct causal claim that the proposed race and ethnicity question will result in better representation in the Census data. Although a number of our findings such as identification as White and Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) had the expected direction of the treatment effect, we also observed identification as Hispanic and Other displayed treatment effects in the opposite direction of our hypothesis. However, the majority of these findings lacked statistical significance due to being underpowered. For one of our results, we found a causal effect of providing ethnic subcategory check boxes in addition to the race category, resulting in a 28% increase in disclosure of ethnic subgroups in the White race.
